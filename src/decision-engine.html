            <div class="row">
                <div class="row-content">
                    <div class="row-marker">1</div>
                    <h5>Create a Decision Table</h5>

                    <p>Intuitive interface works just as you expect. Simply add some fields to your data model, and define rules that rely on it.</p>
                    <p>
                        Our concept is simple: <br>
                        - table have columns, each column is a field in your data model; <br>
                        - each row in this table is a rule; <br>
                        - each cell is a validator.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Whenever all validators are passed in a rule - we will return it’s Decision, Title and Description to a API consumer.
                        Rules executed in same order as you defined them.
                    </p>

                    <h5>Generate sample request with Debugger</h5>

                    <p>
                        After creating table go to built-in debugger to try your results.
                        Enter sample data in it’s form, submit and get your first Decision!

                    <p>
                        Generate credentials on Setting page, call Gandalf from an external system by copy-pasting sample request from debugger to your CLI.
