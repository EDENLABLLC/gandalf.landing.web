    <p>
        We â€“ are product-oriented fintech team. Almost all project that we created need a decision engine that reduces business risks. And all solutions we could find is ether old and ugly, or very expensive. So we decided to create free open-source alternative, that will be scalable, reliable and flexible enough to cover 95% of cases.
        <br>
        To make is suitable for Big Data we decided to build it on top of reliable open-source database MongoDB, that have good scaling capabilities and easy to maintain.
        <br>
        Also we believe that vendor-lock is a bad thing, so we published all source code under a GPL license, feel free to change it as you wish.
