                    <h5>Create a Scoring Table</h5>

                    <p>Intuitive interface works just as you expect. Simply add some fields to your data model, and define rules that rely on it.</p>
                    <p>
                        Our concept is simple:<br>
                        - table have columns, each column is a field in your data model;<br>
                        - each row in this table is a rule;<br>
                        - each cell is a validator.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        After creating table go to built-in debugger to try your results.
                        Enter sample data in itâ€™s form, submit and get your first Score!
