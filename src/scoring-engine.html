            <div class="row">
                <div class="row-content">
                    <div class="row-marker">1</div>
                    <h5>Create a Scoring Table</h5>

                    <p>
                      Intuitive interface works just as you expect. Simply add some fields to your data model, and define rules that rely on it.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our concept is simple:<br>
                        - table have columns, each column is a field in your data model;<br>
                        - each row in this table is a rule;<br>
                        - each cell is a validator.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Whenever all validators are passed in a rule - we will add it’s Score to a final Decision, that is returned to a API consumer.
                    </p>
                </div>

                    <h5>Generate sample request with Debugger</h5>

                    <p>
                        After creating table go to built-in debugger to try your results.
                        Enter sample data in it’s form, submit and get your first Score!

                    <p>
                        Generate credentials on Setting page, call Gandalf from an external system by copy-pasting sample request from debugger to your CLI.
